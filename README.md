# res2s2am

## Overview

----

Res2s2am implements a software pipeline for identifying functional non-coding SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism). The ```Res``` stands for ResNet-based, the ```2s``` for involving the bidirectional feature of SNP function in the model, the ```2a``` for biallelic feature and ```m``` for combining the metadata into the model. The model taks encoded DNA sequences and preselected SNP annotation features as input and outputs the corresponding score of a certain SNP.

## Systems Requirements

----

Res2s2am currently only has a command-line based usage and aims for online GUI for future development. To run the scripts for data extraction, preprocessing and machine learning, certain system package dependencies are required as following:
